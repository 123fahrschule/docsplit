Promote Cultural Diplomacy: American artists, performers and thinkers – representing our values and ideals
– can inspire people both at home and all over the world. Through efforts like that of the United States
Information Agency, America’s cultural leaders were deployed around the world during the Cold War as artistic
ambassadors and helped win the war of ideas by demonstrating to the world the promise of America. Artists
can be utilized again to help us win the war of ideas against Islamic extremism. Unfortunately, our resources
for cultural diplomacy are at their lowest level in a decade. Barack Obama will work to reverse this trend and
improve and expand public-private partnerships to expand cultural and arts exchanges throughout the world.
Attract Foreign Talent: The flipside to promoting American arts and culture abroad is welcoming members of
the foreign arts community to America. Opening America’s doors to students and professional artists provides
the kind of two-way cultural understanding that can break down the barriers that feed hatred and fear. As
America tightened visa restrictions after 9/11, the world’s most talented students and artists, who used to come
here, went elsewhere. Barack Obama will streamline the visa process to return America to its rightful place as
the world’s top destination for artists and art students.
Provide Health Care to Artists: Finding affordable health coverage has often been one of the most vexing
obstacles for artists and those in the creative community. Since many artists work independently or have nontraditional employment relationships, employer-based coverage is unavailable and individual policies are
financially out of reach. Barack Obama’s plan will provide all Americans with quality, affordable health care.
His plan includes the creation of a new public program that will allow individuals and small businesses to buy
affordable health care similar to that available to federal employees. His plan also creates a National Health
Insurance Exchange to reform the private insurance market and allow Americans to enroll in participating
private plans, which would have to provide comprehensive benefits, issue every applicant a policy, and charge
fair and stable premiums. For those who still cannot afford coverage, the government will provide a subsidy.
His health plan will lower costs for the typical American family by up to $2,500 per year.
Ensure Tax Fairness for Artists: Barack Obama supports the Artist-Museum Partnership Act, introduced by
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). The Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow artists to deduct the fair
market value of their work, rather than just the costs of the materials, when they make charitable contributions.
